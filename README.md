# pace-api

This is the API endpoint for the PaCE app. This API will be a liaison between the iOS app and the DB data


TODO: 

Demo:

* DB
* API
* Basic app

Pre-launch:
* Import take off sheet data as inventory
* DB of all shapes

TODO:
* When no items found, return an empty json instead of `null`
* Return a `status` as well as the json (maybe?)
